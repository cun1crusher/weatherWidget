# weatherWidget
Common weather widget. Made as part of a study of api and fetch.


Widget made only for study purposes. But I will update it sometimes to build a better widget. 

At the moment widget has **two opitons**: 

1. To see a certain city weather which directly related to me. 
2. To find a city at the input. (If a name of the city exist in different countries, you can try add a country code in search).

e.g. input: Rome  - output: Rome, US. 
input: Rome, IT - output: Rome, IT.
